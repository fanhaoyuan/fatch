# Contributing

Welcome to Fatcher!

Thanks for contributing, and thanks for reading this doc before doing it!

The [Fatcher Docs](https://fatcherjs.github.io/fatcher/) contains information about how to get started, how the community organizes, and more.

See the followings for more details before you decide to contribute:

-   Check whether there is already a Pull Request about your contributing.

Those guidelines, as the name suggests, are only guidelines, not rules.

So, use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to the contribute/development docs.
