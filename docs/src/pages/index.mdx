Fatcher is a HTTP request library based on `Fetch API`.

We can use fatcher in `node.js` and `modern browsers`.

Fatcher`s core is composing a series of middlewares to expand more functions.

## Features

-   Based on Fetch API
-   Promise API Supports
-   TypeScript Supports
-   Composable Middlewares
-   Streams API supports
-   Mini Size (`<= 2KB`)

## Inspiration

Fatcher's inspiration stemming from `koa`.

## How It Works

A fatcher instance is composed a series of middlewares to a high-order async function.

Middlewares can change request context and fetch response.

Middleware using a immutable request context.It make for debug better.

## Why not

#### Axios

Axios is a promise-based HTTP Client for node.js and the browser. On the server-side it uses the native node.js `http` module, while on the client (browser) it uses `XMLHttpRequests`.

But Fatcher based on `fetch` api and fully supports `promise` and `streams` api. `Node.js` and `Modern Browsers` is supported `fetch` api now.
